This is a list of items that should/could be done to improve QMMMReBind.

- Use DistUtils to make QMMMReBind a package for installation so that a path to the module isn't necessary within the script
- Parametrize.py needs to be broken up into smaller modules for easier code reading and testing.
- Make running pdb4amber its own function (DRY principle).
- Does QM region of host have chemically valid molecules (H's added)?
- Class inheritance can be used for PrepareGaussianGuest and PrepareGaussianHostGuest to save space.
- Common functions for reading Gaussian output logs.
- More checks & assertions needed to ensure that the proper number of values exist for the number of host and guest atoms.
- Deeper tests should be performed to ensure that bond/angle parameters are being properly extracted from Hessian.
    - Try a test of Gaussian on water, and use functions to extract Hessian, bond lenths, bond strengths, etc.
- No test for force_constant_bond
- More asserts ought to be implemented in various steps to ensure that proper atom counts, orders, etc. to ensure
    - This suggests the need for a persistent object of system information to be passed between the classes.
- Generalize Gaussian-specific classes for potential input to GAMESS.
- It is good practice not to do "from library import *", but to use functions from libraries using the full library reference.
- Better sorting of various files into directories based on calculation stages, or at least better naming.
- Reading files to find start/end of section and intermediate lines (DRY principle)
- Some variables are not correctly initialized (ints instead of strs, for instance).
- Some paths need to be constructed with os.path.join()
- After conversion from XML to AMBER, or vice versa, check parameters atom by atom.

Notes:
- Changing file reads/writes to use "with" paradigm.
- Region I are the residues *before* the active site residues, while
  Region II are the residues *after* the active site residues.
- The structure defined by qm.pdb looks problematic - long chains of residues far away from guest, and missing chains close to guest.
