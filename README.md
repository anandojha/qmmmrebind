## Background and Introduction 
```bash
Understanding the interaction of metabolites or drugs with biomolecules can help 
improve our understanding of drug discovery and development. Accurate computational 
prediction of kinetic rates or residence times of an intermolecular encounter can help us identify lead drugs. Kinetic binding parameters are often correlated with efficacy rather than binding affinities. The binding kinetic profile of a drug molecule is characterized by the bimolecular association rate constant (k<sub>on</sub>) and the dissociation rate constant (k<sub>off</sub>). Drug-Target residence time (1/ k<sub>off</sub>) has received the most attention from the drug discovery community since drugs with long-lasting target occupancy are often correlated with greater in-vivo efficacy. k<sub>on</sub> is also useful for predicting in-vivo efficacy, particularly related to understanding drug rebinding. Both k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> can be used to compute the binding free energy. A complete kinetic profile (k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub>), in addition to binding free energy, is extremely desirable for the prediction of in-vivo efficacy and further optimization of lead compounds.

```bash
conda create -n qmmmrebind python=3.8
conda activate qmmmrebind # activate the conda environment
conda install openforcefield # install openforcefield
conda install openbabel -c conda-forge # install openbabel
conda install git # install git
```
* Clone the *QMMMReBind* repository :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anandojha/qmmmrebind.git
```
* Perform the following steps to get this package installed quickly on a local linux machine (Installation in the home directory is recommended) : 
```bash
cd qmmmrebind
python setup.py install
python setup.py test  # optionally run tests to check for proper installation 
```
